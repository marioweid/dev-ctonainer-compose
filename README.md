# dev-container-compose

Visual Studio Dev-Container as part of a Docker Compose.
The dev container sits in the same network as all the services from the compose file and can debug stuff in vscode.
The dev container itself is just the defgault rust container, but a container image based on ubuntu or whatever could be build to debug more applications.
